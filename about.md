I am a Principal Scientist at Sage Bionetworks in Seattle, Washington and a Community Manager for mobile and technology platforms. Previously, I worked as a statistician in the Department of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics at the Mayo Clinic for seven years. I have extensive experience working with clinical and genomic data and have long had a passion for exploring innovative ways to make science more open and transparent. My current work involves both innovative research in computational oncology as well as serving as a bridge between biomedical researchers and technology development.

I am an open science advocate and am involved in a number of national efforts to promote a research ecosystem where participants are treated as partners in the research process. I have also been an invited speaker at a number of national and international events to share my experiences living at the intersection of biomedical research and technology.
